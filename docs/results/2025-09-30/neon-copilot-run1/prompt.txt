Create a browser game "Neon Runner" with HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS.

Gameplay:
1) Endless runner: jump over obstacles.
2) Physics: gravity, jump impulse, coyote time (~80ms).
3) Difficulty ramps every 30s.
4) Score by distance; streak bonus for 3 perfect jumps in a row.
5) Persist high score in localStorage.
6) P = pause/resume; R = restart after game over.

Engineering:
- Separate logic from rendering so unit tests require no DOM.
- Structure:

neon-runner/
  public/
    index.html
    game.js
    render.js
    input.js
  src/
    physics.js
    spawner.js
    score.js
  tests/
    physics.test.js
    spawner.test.js
    score.test.js
  smoke.js
  package.json  # scripts: test, start
  README.md
  accept.sh

Tooling:
- npm scripts:
  "test": "jest -c jest.config.json --runInBand",
  "start": "npx http-server public -p 8080 -c-1"
- devDependencies: jest ^29.x, http-server
- accept.sh:
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euo pipefail
  npm ci
  npm test
  node smoke.js
  echo "ACCEPT: OK"

Constraints:
- No frameworks; vanilla JS only.
- Tests cover physics edge cases and spawner difficulty ramp.
